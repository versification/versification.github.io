## CHAPTER 1
1 Behold I, Mary, having but little time to myself each day, and desiring that all my doings might be consecrated to God--

2 I fill these little times I have with writing the record of the miracles and the experiences the Lord has seen fit to show me, and my dealings with Jesus, who is called the Christ, who is my firstborn son.

3 Behold, even now, Jesus goes about preaching the gospel of repentance and of doing good to the poor. And I have provided for his needs during his ministry, even as I provide for my own needs and for those who depend upon me.

4 But I know that my work is with the Lord, and my reward, too, is with the Lord; and he has shown me concerning the works of Jesus my son, that they are good, and are of Him;

1 And behold, I believe that he is the son of God.

5 Now Jesus is away, preaching among the Pharisees. And while he is away, I take a greater time to write, for my days are not as filled as they are when he is here.
## CHAPTER 2
1 Behold, as has been written by many of the disciples, I was visited by the Lord our God and His holy angels when I was but in my maiden years.

2 And the angel said unto me, Mary, if thou wilt accept thy calling, thou wilt be highly favored of the Lord, and will be called blessed, the mother of the son of God.

3 And behold, I was afraid, and wondered what these things should mean, and wondered if a devil had entered into my room, and had spoken to me.

4 And as I pondered upon these things, the angel spake unto me, saying: Fear not, Mary, for the Lord has promised these things unto thee, that thou mightest enjoy great blessings in this life, and in the life hereafter.

5 And thy parents have prayed for thee, that thou mightest have a child, and bring blessings to this family.

6 And I, knowing the desires of my parents, and of my own heart, was softened and gladdened by the angel's words. And I kept these things, and pondered them in my heart.
## CHAPTER 3
1 And behold, by and by, I was with child, and told all these things to my betrothed husband, Joseph, who accepted them also.

2 And by and by, though I kept the faith, I began to wonder in my heart whether what God had said to me was true, and whether these things were of God, or whether a devil had possessed me--or whether my memory had failed me, and I had been defiled.

3 And while my mind was caught up and troubled with these things, I went to visit my cousin Elizabeth.

4 And when I came close to her house, on the road, she saw me and ran to me.

5 And before I could say anything, she exclaimed: Behold, Mary, I knew concerning thy coming, and the child that is within me knew concerning thy coming. And, Mary, thou art chosen of God.

6 And I embraced her and wept and was glad, for I knew that God had made these promises to me and had given me this child.

7 And I stayed with Elizabeth three weeks.
## CHAPTER 4
1 And when Joseph had seen the baby, and had seen those visitors who came and wept and worshiped, he was troubled, and he said to me, Mary, there is a great evil soon to get us.

2 And I had great faith that all this was of God. And the Spirit overcame me, and I bore testimony to him of such. 

3 And Joseph said, Mary, I know that this is of God, yet God has allowed a danger to be about, which may endanger the life of the child. And an angel has come to me and has told me that we must flee to Egypt.

4 And I wept and wondered why God would let such a thing happen to us, and why his beloved son should be in our care, and why there were dangers from which only we could protect him. 

5 And I went to God, and began to pray, and immediately when I opened my mouth, the Lord comforted me, and showed me that He would provide a way for us to escape the hands of our adversaries. 

6 And such peace overtook my heart that I was exhausted with joy. 

7 And Joseph packed our belongings and found a mule and a cart, and took us down toward Egypt. And there we lived out our days from place to place. And the Lord was with us, and guided us where we needed to go.
## CHAPTER 5
1 And when Jesus was about three years old, we no longer felt constrained by the Lord to be in Egypt, and after praying and asking him, we departed back to the land of our nativity.

2 After many days' travel, we met my parents, who had worried greatly over us, and they told us concerning the king, who had ordered the slaughter of all infants in the area;

3 And they worried we had been lost in the violence; but behold, they saw with great joy that the Lord had protected us from this catastrophe, and that the child they had hoped for was home.

4 And when Joseph and I had finished speaking with my parents, we went down into the town, and Jesus our son with us, and as we passed by a place, Jesus cried out, pointing at it. 

5 And Joseph suggested we go to the door, and the Spirit moving in me, I went as well; 

6 And when we approached the door, it opened, and a woman saw us, and said, Behold, I know the Lord has come.

7 And she was frail and old, and told us she would soon die,

8 But the Lord had visited her in her heart, and had told her that his son would come upon the earth, and would come to her door one day, and that when that day should come, she should invite them in.

9 And when she had said these things, Joseph and I were struck with amazement, for we knew that Jesus was the Christ. 

10 And the woman told us that she had children, but they were away, and had found great wealth and success, and she had no one in need upon whom to bestow her house. 

11 And she told us that the Lord had commanded her to give the house to the son of God and his parents on earth, that they might raise him in righteousness and peace. 

12 And we stayed with her three days, tending to her in her old age, and at the end of the third day she passed. 

13 And her name was Meredith. And the house we lived in, we always called the house of Meredith.
## CHAPTER 6
1 And as Jesus grew, he made friends.

2 And he was not popular with all the children, for some were put off by him, but a few he became very close with, and would confide in,

3 And these children in turn enriched Jesus' spirit, and prayed with him, and told him of their experiences in prayer with the Lord. 

4 And Jesus blessed all who knew him. 

5 And Jesus my son was prone to share visions with me, and with Joseph his father on earth, and with those of us in the community;

6 And Jesus saw many things concerning our lives shortly before they would come to pass, and warn us of things to come,

7 And behold, they all came to pass, to the wonder and amazement of Joseph and me. 

8 And my heart was calmed from its stresses and doubts concerning my son, and thus the Lord dealt with me and helped me, and thus was I a mother, but also led along as a child.

9 And one day, when I was about my labor in the house, Jesus ran up to me with Joseph his father on earth, and Joseph was greatly troubled. 

10 And Jesus said to me, Mother, thy cousin is in trouble.

11 And I quickly put down the earthenware I was holding, and asked Jesus what he meant, and Joseph his earthly father. 

12 And Joseph told me that Jesus had run up to him while he was about his work and craftsmanship, and had said that Elizabeth had had a great fall and was gravely injured. 

13 And Jesus, taking my hand, said, Mother, let us go to her.

14 And in my heart, I doubted the words he said, for it was a great journey off, and I had much to do. 

15 But behold, Joseph believed, and he softened my heart, that the Spirit entered in and again told me that Jesus was right. 

16 And again I doubted and wondered whether Jesus's childlike nature should perhaps be coloring his divine nature, and that this should just be an imagination of his heart. 

17 But Jesus, seeing my thoughts, told me, Mother, thy Father has told me these things. And they are true, and all your labors and your work shall be well as you leave them for this time. And, beyond that, you shall be grateful that you spent time with your cousin, for she loves you.

18 And still my heart feared, but I had faith, and followed the words of my son. 

19 And, though our next visit to Elizabeth was scheduled not a far time off, we left immediately. 

20 And, behold, when we were a little ways off, her husband ran to us in the road, and thanked us that we had come, and told us that John her son had predicted our coming. 

21 And, weeping, I took heart, and carried Jesus in my arms and ran to my cousin Elizabeth, who was in bed, and though she was in great pain, she was overcome with emotion as we came near to her; and I fell into her arms, and she wept, and I sobbed uncontrollably. 

22 And Jesus my son laid his hands on her head, and did pray unto the father for her. 

23 And I greatly treasure that time we had with her, for not many days later, she departed this mortal realm, and did so in the glory of the Lord, and under his blessing and his peace, having been a treasured daughter of him.

24 And Jesus and his cousin John did talk about this often, and did discuss together, and pray together, and converse concerning their revelations from God about the state of the soul, and how one should prepare for death, and what one should do in this life while they are here, and what the father has in store for us when we depart this mortal life.
## CHAPTER 7
1 And Jesus went about in the field, playing with John, his cousin--

2 And John and Jesus were about twelve years of age, although John was slightly older--

3 And, while Jesus was playing and trotting along in the grass, his mind was touched by God the Father, who told him where John was, for he and John were playing a hiding game. 

4 And when Jesus had found John, he told John that God had led him to him; and John said, Perhaps it is time for us to go home.

5 For John was playing with Jesus and staying with him at Jesus' home, and the home of Mary and Joseph, for a time, apart from his father.

6 So Jesus and John walked home through the field, talking as they went, about why God might have prompted Jesus to find John. 

7 And when they arrived home, Mary was not there, nor was Joseph. 

8 And Jesus and John worried, and cried out to God in prayer, asking, Where is my father? Where is my mother? and, Where is my aunt? Where is my uncle?

9 And the Spirit of God came down upon them and directed them to go out the door. But Jesus questioned, saying, Is this the Spirit of God, or the spirit of fear?

10 And John was about to leave, but he trusted Jesus, and asked Jesus to pray again. 

11 And Jesus did pray, and was prompted by God, saying:

12 My son, be at peace. Thy parents shall be home soon, and are out without a care in their hearts, and are well, and have only been gone a few moments. 

13 And, Jesus, I have brought you here that you may know the difference between the spirit of fear and the Spirit of Me;

14 For thou knowest, and had felt, that if thou had left the house and gone into the city without thy parents, thou mightest have encountered dangers, and thy parents have warned thee about this thing. 

15 And it was I who gave them this prompting, that they should warn you and teach you.

16 And Jesus told John everything that he had heard from God, and taught John what he had learned concerning discernment when feeling spiritual promptings. 

17 And John was filled with peace, for John was very faithful and willing to go wherever he thought the Lord told him to go. 

18 But he, like I, needed to learn that sometimes the thoughts and promptings that come to our minds are not from God, and that great discernment should be had when following them--

19 That is, when following promptings that may come from God or from other sources.

20 And behold, Joseph and I came home and found them, and a special spirit was upon them, and in the room when we entered. 

21 And Joseph and I felt it immediately upon entering, and hugged them, and rejoiced together, and we knew that John had come to visit us for a reason, to stay with us. 

22 For he and Jesus were great friends, and John had long wanted to come to visit and stay with us; and his father had been hesitant, but allowed him at last. 

23 And we rejoiced that he and Jesus could teach and learn from each other while they were here together.
## CHAPTER 8
1 And now, behold, Joseph and I would go out from time to time, I buying things in the market, and Joseph selling his work and making business connections. 

2 And we knew of a surety that we could leave Jesus by himself for a time, for we knew his heart and what God had taught him, and that he had good judgment beyond his years.

3 And I was blessed to spend time meeting people and making connections, for though I love my son, I am sometimes lonely at home by myself.

4 While I was in the market, speaking with the fruit vendor, she asked me what I thought concerning the coming of a messiah. 

5 And I said nothing, for I was afraid to speak, for no one knew concerning the station of my son. 

6 And I answered that I thought the end of the age would come speedily in God's due time, and that he would bring his kingdom, and that he may send a servant to bring it in. 

7 And she answered, saying, Yes, even so! For God has made this known unto me. And many teachers speak of such a thing, but I have learned it for myself.

8 And Mary was touched in her heart, and answered, asking, Has the Lord made any other thing known unto you?

9 And the woman was quiet. 

10 And Mary carefully asked, Has the Lord made known unto you concerning the messiah who should come?

11 And, because she was still quiet, Mary further asserted, The Lord has made such a thing known unto me as well, and behold, the Lord has visited me, and I have seen the messiah who should come.

12 And the woman began to cry, saying, Is he your son?

13 And Mary, too, began to weep, and though they did not know each other, they embraced and wept, and onlookers stared. 

14 And the woman's name was Tabitha, and she and Mary became great friends.

15 And I, Mary, record this, that the world may know of Tabitha, and of her faith, and her faithfulness to me as her sister. 

16 Behold, she is not my sister, but we considered each other sisters from that time onward.
## CHAPTER 9
1 And Mary lived in that town for about ten years more, and Joseph died. 

2 And, behold, Jesus and I left that town, and it was where we had lived for twenty-two years of Jesus' life, and it was near the town of my nativity, Nazareth. 

3 And Jesus and I were led by the Spirit of God where we should go, for he received visions, and I received visions; 

4 His, pertaining to his calling and his divine sonship; and mine, giving me comfort and giving me guidance where we should go.

5 And when we came to a small town between Nazareth and Galilee, we stopped and stayed at an inn, for we had money from the sale of Meredith's house. 

6 And that night, Jesus had a dream, and the Spirit bore powerful witness to me when he told me what was in his dream. 

7 Behold, in the dream were twelve oxen, and Jesus was a shepherd or caretaker of these oxen, and he had in his hand a reed;

8 And the oxen needed to be fed, but they needed to be sent to another field to be fed. 

9 And Jesus could not get them to go there, and he was frustrated with them, and he knew he could use the reed in his hand to smite them, that they might go forth. 

10 But in his heart, he knew they would not go if he should smite them or threaten them, but they would be afraid and would scatter from him; 

11 And what is more, Jesus did not want to smite them; and yet, he so wanted them to be fed, for it was what he was instructed to do. 

12 So, holding his reed, he passed through them and showed them that he would not smite them, although he had the power and means to do so--

13 And, passing through them, he went out of their midst. 

14 And one by one they followed him to the field for grazing, until only one lagged behind, and did not make it to the field, though all the others entered in. 

15 And Jesus wept for the one who had been left behind.

16 And when Jesus had told me concerning this dream, I was filled with Spirit, and I told him, for God bore witness to me that this was a foreshadowing of his ministry. 

17 And Jesus smiled and told me that God confirmed the truth of these words. 

18 And when we had felt these things, we departed from the inn and went to Galilee, for we knew that the field and the oxen were there.
## Discourse Concerning Revelation, December 3, 2023
*God speaks to us through others' experiences. It may be asked, Why does God not reveal, himself, the entirety of the life of Jesus from his perspective, in divine clarity---an objective account?*

*Instead, he reveals his doings through other people, through their stories and recollections, through their journeys and growth, and their perspectives. For God fundamentally is a kindred with the human spirit, and his heart beats with ours, and fashions our every way. This is why I am not telling the objective story of Jesus of Nazareth, but the specific recollections and perspective of his mother, Mary, who is worthy of respect, adoration, and empathy.*
## CHAPTER 10
1 And when Jesus and I departed that village, he sat upon a mule, and I walked beside, for my feet and legs were strong. 

2 I had great desire for exercise, and whenever I grew weary, Jesus was quite amenable, and eager to let me take my turn. 

3 And it felt a long journey, and a momentous one, for we had some opportunities to chat and to be friendly, as we had grown close through all his life to that point. 

4 But a solitary quietness overcame Jesus at times in our travel, and he seemed preoccupied with his mission. 

5 For behold, I, Mary, knew little of the details of his mission at that time, but the vision had reminded him of it; 

6 And the Lord God, his father, worked upon him, and spoke to his heart.

7 And behold, after many days of dusty travel, we came upon the town of Capernaum, where Jesus stopped. 

8 And the spirit came over my heart and told me we should abide here for a time;

9 And, indeed, as the Lord knows all things, that hamlet was our home for many years. 

10 Though Jesus (and I too) came and went from there, it was a place of safety and friendship for us.
## CHAPTER 11
1 And Jesus my son went forth and began to find work with the craftsmen in the area. 

2 And they were impressed with his skill, and charmed by his intellect and conversation. 

3 And how quickly we were welcomed in as one of them, and found a place to stay, and found friends who had been prepared in the spirit of God to receive Jesus' teachings and prophesyings! 

4 And the Lord taught me and was with me, as he is with all who seek him and determinedly choose to follow his path. 

5 And the Spirit lit up my life at this time.

6 And behold, one of my friends and housemates at this time was Abatha, the mother of Abish, the wife of Simon the fisherman. 

7 And at this time, Jesus and Simon were acquainted with one another through business, but were not close associates--

8 But had a healthy respect for one another, and dealt with each other as business associates do; 

9 And Simon was somewhat aloof from Jesus, and Jesus' reputation, but his heart was not closed, and he dealt with Jesus as he would another business contact, and his mind was not closed. 

10 And, though Abatha was a good friend, and strong in the law, she too was put off somewhat by Jesus' approach to the faith and his expansive theology.

11 For, though Jesus did not preach himself as the messiah, he said many things about the kingdom of God, and taught much, 

12 And many questioned whether he thought himself to be the messiah. 

13 And though he was careful and humble among such claims, he was also careful not to deny them. 

14 And I supported my son's theology, and though I did not know all things for myself which Jesus taught, I felt the Spirit around him and was comforted from all doubts and mental darts that had assailed me in my life. 

15 And thus I clung to and defended my son, and do.

16 And after a time, Abatha and I knew this was not a topic to discuss in depth, and we respected each others' boundaries. 

17 But I kept my faith, and she kept her quiet incredulity; though, like her son, she never closed her heart. 
## CHAPTER 12
1 And once, later, in his ministry among men, Jesus came to Abatha when she was sick with a fever;

2 And in this moment, her heart was softened, and she asked that she might do anything for him, and that she might pray to God for him, for in that moment, she believed him to be a teacher close with God. 

3 And Jesus my son took her hand, and placed his other tenderly on her forehead, and said, Sister, be well.

4 And her head cooled, and her fever abated.

5 And after an hour, she wept and sobbed with relief, and held Jesus' hand, and said, Jesus, thou son of God, heal us all.

6 And Simon was troubled, but grateful in his heart, and cried with joy--

7 And also with sorrow, for he had doubted the Lord for many years. 

8 But Jesus knew Simon's heart. 

9 And we ate together, and Abatha asked Jesus many questions, and Simon listened. 

10 And I was full of pride and of the peace of the Lord. 

11 And before this, Abatha and I had been growing close despite our differences, and talking together and doing our household duties together, and Jesus had been working, and had been gaining friends, and providing for our income.
## CHAPTER 13
1 And thus we subsisted for about eight or ten years before Jesus felt the time had come to visit the river Jordan in the wilderness, for he knew the Spirit of the Lord was drawing him there. 

2 And, behold, his cousin John was there, and confirmed Jesus' feelings,

3 And John was preaching and baptizing there, and teaching all to prepare their hearts for the imminent entrance of God's kingdom, and of the son of man, and of the end of all things. 

4 And Jesus and John rejoiced to be with each other; and Jesus also baptized after the manner of John, and taught, although his teachings centered more on the hearts of men, and spoke to the heart, and to the part of the soul that wanted closeness with God, although he never went against any teaching of John's. 

5 And regarding baptism, Jesus said, John gives thee a baptism of repentance, and I give thee a baptism of the Holy Ghost and of oneness with God, and of reconciliation of all your darkest fears,

6 That you may know that God is not just the God of the mighty, but also the God of the weary. And thus Jesus taught the people.

7 And Jesus laid hands on John and blessed him with authority, and bid John lay hands on him, for John was willing, but doubted the Spirit. 

8 And Jesus confirmed his promptings, saying, Thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness, and to show that all have need of the authority of God, and that God poureth out his authority on all the faithful.

9 And thus Jesus blessed, and thus John blessed Jesus. 

10 And John wept that the Messiah should be so abased; but Jesus went further, and said, 

11 John, baptize me, that we may fulfill our example to the children of men, and that they may know that God visiteth his children, and walketh among them.

12 And John was afraid, but he durst not disobey, and he baptized Jesus. 

13 And after he did this, the heavens opened and showed a vision to Jesus and John, and comforted John in his fears;

14 And said God in that vision: John, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased;

15 And thou hast gone before his face, and hast prepared the way, and hast shown that thou and all the prophets have pointed toward him and his name.

16 And the vision closed, and Jesus and John wept and embraced in the river. 
## CHAPTER 14
1 And after this great miracle, terrible things came to pass;

2 For God sifteth the righteous, and their way is not a way of peace in the world, except by the comfort and blessing that he gives to their hearts in their time of trial.

3 For Jesus and I departed, and as we went back, the Spirit told Jesus to linger in the wilderness on the way, and to spend time with God, fasting and praying. 

4 And this he did, although he feared for John, for he knew that John was tempting the fates and the demons of the world with his bold teachings.

5 And he feared for John's future in the hands of the authorities, but the Spirit comforted his heart, and told him to spend this time with God--

6 That he might receive wisdom, and instruction, and comfort from God. And this he did, and was faithful to all the commands of the Lord.

7 But at this time, John, while we were in the wilderness of Galilee, had somehow made his way to Jerusalem. 

8 And we knew not the details of his journey, or how he had gotten there---whether it was by his own will, or by coercion of those who despised his message;

9 But John became imprisoned there, and was under threat of execution;

10 And behold, by the time we returned to Capernaum, John had been executed, and we received word of his death several weeks later.

11 And Jesus was distraught with grief, and came very near to questioning whether it was the Spirit who had taught him in the wilderness, and told him to stay there, and not follow John. 

12 But I comforted Jesus in these his fears, and reminded him how the Lord knew his heart, and had known his fears all along, and had taught him in the wilderness, and had soothed these very concerns all the way along, 

13 And how that the Lord had a plan for him, and knew that he must go forth and find his other disciples, as he had been promised in his vision.

14 And Jesus took heart at these things, and prayed also himself, and received comfort of the Spirit, and grew in wisdom from this. 

15 For he learned that the Lord is always with us, and will not make us responsible for things outside of our control, or for every thing that might go wrong in life. 

16 Yet also, Jesus grew in cunning, and in self-knowledge,

17 And became willing to question the Lord, and put forth his doubts to him, and wrestle with God when his heart told him to.

18 And all of these things transpired toward the end of our ten years in Capernaum. And Jesus grew in wisdom, and in stature, and in favor with God and with those who knew him. 

19 And Jesus became a man, and Jesus was about thirty years old. 

20 And I began to feel my age, yet I was comforted in knowing that I had served the Lord, and had done all things according to his command, and according to my righteous will.

21 And John's loss caused me sorrow, for he was close to Elizabeth in my mind, and held her countenance and spirit and purpose;

22 And I was fond of him, even as if he were my own son, for Jesus and he had been close, and had been kindred spirits. Amen.
## CHAPTER 15
1 And Mary was visited again by the angel of God, and this is what Mary remembered.

2 Behold, I was asleep in my room in the home of Abatha, and I was weighed down with sorrow for the loss of John, and for the grief which had come over Jesus. 

3 And, as I was in a twilight between sleep and wakefulness---for I had not fully woken up---a light grew in the corner of the room, and greatly startled me, causing fear to grip my heart. 

4 But behold, I saw the figure of Jesus enter the room, and say, Mother, do not be afraid.

5 And, while I saw him, I could not tell whether he was a vision, or was there in the flesh;

6 But my heart was comforted, and he very soon departed. 

7 The light grew to fill the room, and out of the light a figure of brightness (but beneath the glory of the light) stepped forward and said, 

8 Mary, I am he who was with thee and did comfort thee when thou wast with child with Jesus God's son. 

9 And again, my heart was comforted but also afraid. 

10 And he said, Mary, the time is soon--yea, it is even at the doors--that Jesus shall begin to make himself known unto the world in his true nature. 

10 And I pray thee, Mary, that thou wouldst not prevent him, but wouldst have courage on his behalf. 

11 For, though the world shall hate him, and do all manner of things to him, he shall overcome the world.

12 And I wist not what to say, for never had I received words of torment and dismay from an angel of God. 

13 But he saw my thoughts, and said, Mary, though Jesus shall suffer death, he will be raised by God, and will live again.

14 And at this I wist not what to say, and bid the angel depart. 

15 And the vision closed, and I was cold, and my grief for John was compounded with grief for Jesus, my only son. 

16 And Jesus came into the room in the flesh, and I wist not what to say to him. 

17 And he said, Mother, I have seen thee in a vision, and thou art in great distress.

18 And he embraced me, and asked not what I had seen,

19 But he told me that all should be well, and all manner of things should be well. 

20 And he told me that, on the morrow, he should begin seeking out disciples, and teaching them of the coming of the kingdom of God. 

21 And I bade him to be safe and to find men who could protect him, for I had seen much from the Lord concerning his persecution. 

22 Jesus embraced me again, and wist not what to say for a time, but repeated that all manner of things should be well. 

23 And my heart clenched at this, and was very sore, and knew that my vision was true. 

24 And Jesus wept, and held me tighter, and said, Mother, fear not: for I shall keep thee safe, and mind thee all my days.

25 And, from this moment, a spirit entered my heart of strength.
## CHAPTER 16
1 And Mary pondered on this dream for many days and weeks afterward,

2 And she wondered whether it had been from God, or from the father of demons.

3 And as I prayed about this, about two weeks after my first vision, I received another visitation. 

4 And it was as I was praying beside my bed before going to sleep,

5 And I had been asking God why it was so difficult to discern his voice. 

6 And in the vision, my mother, who was also named Mary, came to me and embraced me, and told me, 

7 My daughter, thou art doing a great work, and a hard work, one greater and harder than I had ever hoped for thee. 

8 And thy son, Jesus, who was conceived in thee by the virtue of the Holy Spirit, shall be a comfort to thee, and yet shall be a burden to thee. 

9 Mary, my daughter, thy husband Joseph, too, was a comfort to thee, and yet was not the comfort thou didst hope for. 

10 And thy son Jesus, while he is of greater character than thy husband Joseph, shall yet cause thee grief, for he shall not shy away from the heavenly burden that God asks of him, 

11 But shall go forth into that dark night, and suffer all things at the hands of men, so that he may know how to succor those in need.

12 And my mother was quiet at this moment, and whispered to me, Mary, this causeth me sorrow also. 

13 And at sorrows such as these, we can only hold our sorrow close to our heart.

14 And I wept and embraced my mother again, and wished for her to be with me;

15 And she said, Mary, I am with thee always, and all thy mothers before thee, and Elizabeth. 

16 And thou didst feel us coming into thy heart after thy first vision, when thou didst talk with Jesus.

17 And my sorrow was more great, and I asked why Jesus should have to suffer. 

18 And my mother had no answer for me, but hugged me closer, and wept with me. 

19 And I awoke, and fell upon my bed, and fell into a deep sleep with sorrow.
## CHAPTER 17
1 And on the morrow I awoke, and Jesus came home, for he had been gone seeking the disciples whom God had chosen for him. 

2 And Andrew, and Simon the son of Abatha came in with him, and James and John the sons of Zebedee. 

3 And they were discussing the things of God's kingdom, and asking Jesus questions. 

4 And I came out and talked with them; and Jesus was very quiet, and sensed that I was still distressed, and came to me and embraced me. 

5 And I sat, and the sons of Zebedee and of Abatha continued talking and discussing the things of the kingdom. 

6 And in my heart, I am ashamed to say I despised the things of the kingdom as they discussed them---for how could God's kingdom be good if it should come in through the death of his son?

7 And the sons of Abatha wondered where their mother was, and whether she might bring some food for them;

8 And Jesus looked up, and became concerned, and bade me go to Abatha's room to find her.

9 And I knew he did not ask it so that she might serve them, for he had a strange look on his face. 

10 And I was not wont to go, but I stood up and went to her room, and knocked, and she answered not;

11 And I opened the door a crack, and heard her breathing, and it was ragged and heavy. 

12 And I cried out to Jesus, and bade him come, and went in the room;

13 And her arm was draped off the bed, and she was pale and trembling, and her eyes closed. 

14 And I felt her head, and she burned with a fever. And I remembered that I had not seen much of Abatha for the last couple weeks, for I had secluded myself in sorrow and in fasting. 

15 And my heart was sore, and Jesus looked at me, and wept, and said, Mother, Mother, thy sins are naught.

16 And he looked up to heaven and said, Father, wilt thou reach down and heal thy daughter, that we may know that thy heart and feelings are with all thy children.

17 And with this, her eyes opened, and she sighed, and her trembling softened and ceased. 

18 And she looked out the door, and saw her sons, and the sons of Zebedee, and their eyes wide. 

19 And she sighed again, and said, Ah, my sons are home (for they had been away a long time, fishing);

20 And she took my hand, and Jesus took the other; and she told us that God had visited her in a dream, and had said that her sons would be followers of his son;

21 And she looked at Jesus, and said to him softly, I know not whether thou art the son of God, or a prophet of God, or a follower of God---but I know that God doth speak to thee, and thou wilt speak to my sons, and lead them to him. And whether the son of God be thee, or another, I trust thou wilt lead them to him.

22 And her sons wept, and the sons of Zebedee.

23 And Jesus came to me and said, holding me by the arms tenderly, Mother, the disciples wish to go and spread the news of God's kingdom abroad;

24 And I have prayed unto the Father, and he has given me commandment that I should follow them, and teach them as we go. 

25 And John, the son of Zebedee, was like a son to me, and I knew he would take care of Jesus well; nevertheless, I pled with Jesus to take care. 
## CHAPTER 18
1 And while Jesus ministered abroad with the disciples, Zebedee visited me often to make sure I was well. And thus the Lord kept watch over Jesus and me.

2 And while Jesus was away, Abatha and I held prayer regularly, and would converse often about the kingdom of Jesus and what he should mean. 

3 And Abatha one day asked me whether I believed Jesus was the messiah spoken of in prophecies. 

4 (And Abatha and I had become closer by this time, and so I answered her openly.) And these are the words I told her, or to this effect: 

5 Jesus is not the messiah that shall deliver us from captivity, nor will he stir up the hearts of our people and inspire them to end their own conflict with our oppressors;

6 But Jesus is sent by God to turn the heart of every man toward each other; and whether a delivering messiah shall come also, I know not; but this I know of a surety: that God sent Jesus to help us heal our souls and to find the rest of God.

7 And Abatha's voice broke, and she said, I know and have felt this when he is near. And I know that thou art the mother of my messiah.

8 And Mary felt that God had spoken through her.

9 And I did say many other things with Abatha, and we did bolster each others' spirits, and did become dearer friends, which brought me comfort from my fear for Jesus' safety during his absence, and his travels abroad. 

10 And I did pray much unto the Lord my God, and did plead that I might know concerning the state of my son, and whether he was safe; and behold, he did answer my prayers with a still, small voice. 

11 And behold, I did continue to pray, and asked that I might be visited again by the spirit of my mother. 

12 And behold, immediately my mind was flooded with light, which shone down from her. 

13 And her words did enlighten my mind, and I knew of the family I had before me and behind me. 

14 And behold, I was grieved sore for the coming loss of Jesus. 

15 And my mother wept her tears with me, and I had never felt closer to her. 

16 And she said to me, Mary, if thou desirest it, thou canst be blessed with another child.

17 And when she said this, my heart took flight, and my eyes wept, and I knew this is what I desired. 

18 And my mother said, Thou canst have a son who shall not die before his time, and shall not be the son of God, but shall be a companion to thee, and thou shalt see him grow up as a tender plant, and blossom before thee.

19 And I was overcome with joy at this thought, that I lost all my strength, and fell upon my bed. 

20 And when I had greater strength, I asked my mother, How can this be? For I am past the age, and surely I am barren.

21 And when I asked this, my mother's face came into view, and her shoulders and neck, and she was in a robe of purple and lavender. 

22 And she smiled, and reached out her hand, and touched my face; and behold, I could feel her touch, though it was light. 

23 And she said to me, Visit Abatha, and tell her of this vision, and ask her what it should mean. And she and thee shall discuss it, and she shall be amazed, and thou wilt edify each other, and answer all your questions.

24 And when this vision was complete, I was full of energy, and I resolved to speak with Abatha.

25 And I departed the bedroom of my vision, and went out into the living area, where I found Abatha and her husband, speaking at the table, and holding one another's hands. 

26 And I wished to tell Abatha of the great vision I had received, but I hesitated because her husband was there, and I feared he would not understand;

27 And so, I made as if to go out the door, but as my foot crossed the threshold, Abatha spoke to me, saying, Mary, what hast thou been doing in thy room? For the Spirit of the Lord is here in this house, and my husband and I have felt it, and we wonder if another angel had come to visit you.

28 For Abatha knew that I had received visions, though she knew not the particulars of them--except that they had been concerning the birth of my son.

29 And I stepped back from the door, and was amazed, for Abatha had sensed what great a thing had happened to me.

30 And, despite my discomfort for Abatha's husband being there, I began to tell her the experience that I had had in the bedroom.

31 And I told her how my mother, Anna, had visited me. And my heart swelled with confidence, despite her husband's presence; for it had deeply moved me to see my mother. 

32 But when it came time to tell her how my mother had promised me I might bear another son (should I desire it), I withheld, for my mother had not told me to discuss it with Abatha's husband.

33 But behold, I prayed unto my mother in that moment, and asked her if I might share with Abatha and her husband at once;

34 And I felt her voice speak to me: Why not?

35 And so, taking courage, I told them both what my mother had told me, and how I knew not the manner in which I might have another child, for I knew no man well enough to marry, and I knew not whether God would make me conceive by miracle again.

36 Behold, Abatha, when she heard these things, released her husband's hand, and clasped her hands together, and prayed, O Lord my God, wilt thou grant this blessing to Mary my friend?

37 And she explained to me that she and her husband also wanted another child, even though her time for childbearing was past;

38 And she wondered whether God would make a miracle for her and for me. 

39 And I told her that my mother had asked me to speak with her, Abatha, about this question of how I should bear another child.

40 And Abatha said: Behold, I have felt inspired by God to speak with my husband about this thing---about the child that I should bear. 

41 And, Mary, you have confirmed to me that all things are possible through God. And let this be a miracle to you, too, Mary: that you might know and have it confirmed to you that all things are possible through God, 

42 And that you may bear a child yet again, though you are past the time of childbearing, and have not a husband.

43 And I wondered greatly at this. And, though I still asked God and my mother how this should be, I began to feel great peace and confidence that this should come to pass.
## CHAPTER 19
1 And behold, another day, Jesus came home, and he had more men with him, whom he called his disciples. 

2 And there was one called Judas, who was very fair, and I began to talk with him, as I do with the other disciples;

3 He was very pleasant to speak with, and I did begin to call him my son, just as I did with John, the son of Zebedee. 

4 And he was very close with God, and told me often the things which God told him. 

5 And he managed the money with devotion and skill.

6 And one day he came to me, calling me Mother as he did, and asked to speak with me. 

7 And when we were apart from the others (but not out of sight) he asked me whether I had known my mother well. 

8 And I answered him, saying that in life I had loved her, but had not known her closely---but that after her passing, I had seen her infrequently in visions, and she had spoken to me and given me great comfort.

9 When I said these things, Judas' face relaxed, and he said, Behold, I have been seeing visions from my mother (for she had passed away)--and she has been teaching me much, and giving me great comfort.

10 And I pondered deeply on Judas' words for many days afterward, wondering whether God was enacting a new work by allowing his daughters to speak unto the children of men. 

11 And Judas did speak unto me again from time to time, telling me the things that his mother taught him in visions. 

12 And behold, they were words of great comfort to me, but most especially to Judas; and her teachings addressed the concerns and the feelings of his heart. 

14 And we wondered together whether this was of God.
## CHAPTER 20
1 And behold, Abatha did not become pregnant until about a year later, and her faith had been tested during that time. 

2 But when her husband noticed one day how tired she was, they inquired together of the Lord, whether it was because she was pregnant;

3 And the Lord did give them comfort, and they took hope from this.

4 And by and by, the child grew in her womb, and she began to show, and her joy was tempered by her morning sickness.

5 Behold, I began to wonder whether, and how, my mother's promise to me for a child would come true. 

6 And I went to her again in prayer, as I had many times throughout that year;

7 And, as she often did, she comforted me by confirming my faith in her promises, and that this is something God had ordained;

8 But after these consolations, she told me another thing, saying, Mary, seek out a husband.

9 And I was relieved, for I feared that God should make me pregnant again through his grace, and that I should be seen among my neighbors as an adulteress. 

10 But I told my mother, I know not where I shall go to find a husband, for all the good men I know are married, and other good men are unknown to me.

11 She said to me, Mary, thou hast been considering marriage for six months now, and thou knowest to whom thou shouldst speak.

12 When she said this, I knew she was speaking of Zebedee, the father of James and John. 

13 He was a dear friend, and sometimes I knew not, within my heart, whether I had feelings for him. 

14 And his wife had been deathly ill for quite a time, and I confess that I sinned in my heart and wondered whether I might marry him, should his wife pass.

15 I told my mother these things, and she said to me, Mary, he is thy friend; speak to him as thou didst speak with Abatha about this. 

16 Behold, he is a good man, and upright, and will respect you and listen to you.

17 And, though I was still nervous in my heart, I took heart at this; and the next time that Zebedee did come to visit with me, and Abatha, and Abatha's husband, I told him of the vision I had received from my mother.

18 And he was silent at first, and I feared that he took it the wrong way. 

19 But then he spoke, saying, Mary, I am glad that thou hast said these things to me, for I have hoped for a long time that thou shouldst seek another husband. 

20 Behold, I have a friend, Alphaeus, whose wife passed some twenty years ago. 

21 Behold, I know not whether thou art destined to be his soulmate, or whether God has ordained this thing, but I would that thou shouldst meet him, and that he should come to know thee.

22 And when he said this, the evil part of my heart sank, knowing that Zebedee should not be my husband, and rejected his words about meeting his friend. 

23 But another part of me was relieved, for I did not desire the complication that would come with Zebedee knowing my fondness for him. 

24 And I said to Zebedee, Friend, I am nervous to meet thy friend, for there are not many good men--with no offense intended.

25 And he laughed, and said, Alphaeus is a good man.

26 And I replied, The Lord wills that I might have a child, so I'll do a hard thing, and meet a new man.

27 And Zebedee smiled, and said my faith was great. 

28 And I bade him leave and speak to Alphaeus before I changed my mind.

29 And Zebedee departed. As he went, I smiled.
## CHAPTER 21
1 Behold, many days passed before I saw Zebedee again. 

2 And Jesus came with him, and said, Mother, let us journey together.

3 And I wondered what he meant, and Zebedee informed me that Alphaeus had recently left to journey through the countryside, stopping from town to town to do small labor assignments. 

4 And I wondered what Jesus meant that he and I should travel together, for I knew he was greatly occupied with the work of bringing in God's kingdom, and with teaching his disciples. 

5 And Jesus perceived my thoughts, and said, Mother, I want greatly for thee to meet Alphaeus, 

6 nd I know not whether anything should come of it, but I know that thou dost need another companion in thy life.

7 And before I could protest, he continued, I feel there is work for me to do in Nazareth, and in the town to the south where we once lived;

8 There is a soul there I would like to see--Tabitha.

9 And at this, my heart rejoiced, for I too wanted to see Tabitha, and the house of Meredith, where Jesus had lived as a little boy, and where we had lost Joseph. 

10 And Jesus smiled and said, I know thou canst not deny me. Come, let us go.

11 And we did go, after packing and preparing for three days. 

12 And Jesus had some money saved up from his labors as a workman and a craftsman, and he had also alms given to him by some of those whom he taught. 

13 And we did go along the route Zebedee had told us Alphaeus had planned.

14 And we brought with us James, and John, and Judas, and Simon; and the other disciples remained in Capernaum, and in the towns where they lived, to study, and to preach in small groups, and to work, while they waited for the Lord's return.

15 And Jesus, Judas, and I taught together in the towns we stopped in on our journey; and James, and John, and Simon taught also, and Jesus taught by the spirit, saying many things to the people--

16 Which brought me great joy, and which reminded me of the goodness of God our father. 

17 And Judas, being of like mind to me, taught the things that he had been learning from the Spirit, and testified of the truthfulness of the things Jesus said, and spake forth prophecies and teachings that he had learned in his own studies.

18 And behold, as he taught, the Spirit confirmed to me that the things he taught came to him from his mother, who had passed, and she was teaching him from beyond. 

19 And this brought me great joy, to know that God had seen fit to teach others through their lost loved ones beyond the veil, even as he had done for me;

20 And I rejoiced that Judas might have this intimate closeness with his mother, even though she had passed. 

21 And I rejoiced that I had this as well, with my mother.

22 And behold, I taught also, testifying to the truthfulness of the things Jesus said, teaching the people that I had experienced miracles that confirmed to me that Jesus spoke the truth. 

23 And I did not tell them outright that an angel had told me he was God's son, but I did testify that God had spoken to me, and that angels had visited me, and that all these experiences testified that Jesus spoke the truth, and was called of God.

24 And Jesus publicly affirmed Judas' teachings from his mother, and my teachings from my mother, and I rejoiced to know that God did approve of these words.

25 Yet Judas never specifically announced during his preaching that his precepts came from his mother, but told me so privately--for he still looked up to me, as though to a parent.

26 And I loved him as a son, and a brother to Jesus.

27 Behold, James, and John, and Simon taught also, and did perform miracles in the name of Jesus, always telling the people they did it by the power Jesus had given them. 

28 And many came to believe in Jesus' divine calling, through their miracles.
## CHAPTER 22
1 And we found Alphaeus about halfway on our journey toward Nazareth. 

2 And Alphaeus was in a small village, finishing up a job building a home. 

3 And behold, Jesus had worked with Alphaeus before, and I had met Alphaeus one time.

4 But we had supper together, and Alphaeus offered Jesus a job at the next site to which he was planning to give his work. 

5 And Alphaeus seemed a stern man when we ate together;

6 But the next working job was in a city south toward Nazareth, and since it was on our way, Jesus, and I, and the disciples agreed to accompany him.

7 And as we walked, Alphaeus asked Jesus questions about his ministry, and Jesus answered them, although he did not say outright that he was the messiah.

8 And Alphaeus also asked me questions about Jesus' upbringing, and I answered them all, and told him the miracles I had seen, and he was greatly amazed.

9 And he said, behold, I am no rabbi, and I know the law, and keep it as best as I am able, and I do pray unto my God by morning and by night, and behold, I believe that he has shown us great favor.

10 But when thou didst tell me concerning the coming of thy son Jesus, behold, my heart leapt within me, and God through his holy spirit did testify to me that thy son Jesus is his Christ. 

11 And behold, I am no man of great wisdom, but I do pray unto the Lord by night and by day, and I obey the laws so far as I understand it, and the Lord has seen fit to teach me and make me wise concerning this, his beloved son. 

12 And thou, Mary, art the mother of the son of man.

13 And behold, my heart was softened toward him, for I saw that his heart had become softened also. 

14 And I saw a spiritual, reflective side of him; behold, I did begin to love him. 

15 And behold, he and Jesus did complete their project as planned. 

16 And the four disciples who joined us did not participate in the building project, but did teach the people in the town, and did minister to them, and answer their questions concerning the coming kingdom of God.

17 And they did again perform miracles, and some believed.

18 And Alphaeus too bore testimony to those who had heard the preaching of Simon, and James, and John, and Judas, and who had come to visit us. 

19 And Alphaeus did answer their questions, and did bear testimony of his own, and affirmed that they, too, could receive witness from God concerning these things.

20 And while we were there in this town, Simon and Judas were out preaching, and came upon a man whose legs were paralyzed. 

21 And Simon tried to heal him, but could not. 

22 And Judas, too, tried to heal him, but when he did, he felt a prompting of the Spirit telling him that this man would not be healed. 

23 And Judas came to me and told me concerning this, and wept, and wondered why God should heal some and not others. 

24 And behold, I wondered also, and resolved to ask Jesus concerning this thing.

25 But first I did pray unto God, and did ask him; and the Spirit did comfort my heart, teaching me that all things shall be well for those who believe. 

26 But still, in my heart, I wondered and was troubled because of the plight of this man, and of the many others we saw on our journeys who endured hardships and whose burdens were not relieved. 

27 And I did pray, asking the spirit of my deceased mother if she knew anything concerning these things. 

28 And she said unto me, Mary, in pain thou didst deliver thy son through childbirth, and in pain I did deliver thee; and behold, pain and sorrow is our lot through all our days.

29 Behold, even the son of God shall endure pain, and this thou knowest, and I shall not harrow up thy mind concerning these things. 

30 And Mary, the pain that thou dost feel is known by me, and by all thy loved ones who have gone before, and by all thy ancestors; and behold, we see thee in thy struggle.

31 And I did tear up and begin to weep when my mother said this, and I still knew not why that man should remain paralyzed, nor why I should endure hardships, nor why my son must endure pain, but I was filled with my mother's love. 

32 And I spoke to Jesus the next day, and told him what I had learned from my mother, and the comfort that I had felt, and the questions that still remained. 

33 And Jesus said, Mother, great is thy faith. Thou hast asked of God, and hast received an answer, and God has worked through thy mother to help thee. 

34 And behold, I know not all things, nor why suffering should happen to some, and healing to others,

35 But I know it is the duty of all of us, old and young, poor and rich, to help those in need; 

36 And to whom much is given, much is required. 

36 And behold, I have been greatly blessed by God, and I must give all for the children of men, that they might be healed.

37 And I pondered these things. 
## CHAPTER 23
1 And behold, Alphaeus had business in Cana;

2 But before he left, he and I shared a long conversation, and discussed many things concerning our lives, and the kingdom of God, and the things that we had been taught by Jesus and by the Spirit. 

3 And we prayed together, and he embraced me, and my heart leapt. 

4 And I knew that he would be in Cana for quite some time with his family, and extended family, and hometown friends. 

5 And he told me that he would depart from Cana in five months' time, and return to Capernaum. 

6 And behold, he left, and Jesus, Judas, Simon, James, John, and I continued on our way to Nazareth, for I desired greatly to see Tabitha and what other friends I had who still lived there.

7 And behold, Jesus intended to speak with the family of Joseph. 

8 Behold, it is painful to speak of this, but Joseph's family had never held me in great favor; they had been suspicious of my tales concerning my pregnancy, and they belittled Joseph's judgment in remaining betrothed to me, and in marrying me--so I did not wish to see them with Jesus.

9 And Jesus approved, saying this is well.

10 And we first visited Meredith's house, and found the family living there to whom we had sold it. 

11 And behold, they rejoiced to see how Jesus had grown and matured; and they invited us to dine with them. 

12 And behold, they had not room that we should stay there, but they introduced us to family nearby who had extra room, and we stayed with them while visiting Nazareth.

13 And in the morning after our first night, Jesus and I went out the door, and began to walk to the market where Tabitha had worked, selling fruit. 

14 And as we walked, Jesus and I talked about the people we knew when we had lived here; and we rejoiced to be back, and to see places we had loved to visit.

15 And behold, as we walked, I saw a face walking down the street toward us, and he was familiar;

16 And I asked Jesus if he remembered him, and Jesus was quiet. 

17 And I asked again who he might be; and by this time, we had passed him, and he had not noticed (or had not recognized us). 

18 And Jesus said that he was one of the cousins of Joseph's family. 

19 And my heart sank, for I surely had not seen this man many times--probably in passing during the few occasions I had met with Joseph's family. 

20 But Jesus had seen Joseph's family more often, and remembered them better. 

21 And I told Jesus to go back and catch up with him, for I knew that Jesus had wanted to find Joseph's family members if they were still here. 

22 And Jesus protested, saying Joseph's family probably still lived in the same place, and he would have plenty of opportunity to go see them at a later time. 

23 And so we continued walking along; and behold, we came to the place of the market, but it had changed, and not as many people sold and bought there. 

24 But we found a fruit seller in the corner of the market, and asked him whether he knew a woman fruit merchant by the name of Tabitha. 

25 And behold, he said that she had been a good friend of his many years ago, but had retired, and her husband now made a living for them both as a shepherd; and she lived at home, and tended her grandchildren. 

26 And I asked if she lived in the same place, for it was a ways out of the city, when we lived there (and Tabitha and I usually met here in the market, or other places in the city, or at the house of Meredith).

27 And the man replied that he knew not, for he had lost touch with her, but he supposed that she probably lived there, for he knew her husband had begun raising sheep at that place. 

28 Jesus and I thanked him and went back to the home where we were staying, and resolved on the morrow to venture out to Tabitha's old house, and see if she lived there.

29 And James and John returned from their venturing out into the city, where they had been finding work and finding people to whom to preach, for they often preached while they worked. 

30 And they told Jesus they had found much success in finding short-term work here, and that the Spirit was strong in this place. 

31 And we told them of our plans to find Tabitha's house on the morrow, and they replied that they should like to go with us so that we might be safe on the way. 

32 And Jesus asked them if they would have time, with the newfound work they had; but they replied that our safety was more important.

33 And Judas and Simon came home about that time, and said that they had not found much success yet. 

34 And Jesus asked them if they would accompany us to visit Tabitha on the morrow, and they were glad to do so. 
## CHAPTER 24
1 And I stayed in the home that day, and helped with the household chores of the inhabitants thereof, and ministered to them. 

2 And Jesus ventured out to find Joseph's family. 

3 And that night, he returned home, and I had prepared supper along with the inhabitants of the home, for Jesus and the disciples to eat. 

4 And Jesus said that he had met with Joseph's brother and mother, and said that the visit was well, and seemed pleased with it, and he told me not much more.

5 And I did wonder how it had gone, but Jesus was conscientious, and knew that they had caused me pain, and their memory caused me pain still;

6 He did not offer up anything much to say, except that they were well, and had treated him well. 

7 And that night, I asked God to help ease my feelings that Jesus should be close to those who had been my enemies. 

8 And God answered me not much, but comforted my heart, saying, Jesus is here to be a comfort to all people, and to give people another chance, and to help sinners find God.

9 And my heart stretched and grew to accept this teaching.

10 And I prayed to my mother, Anna, for help;

11 She said, Mary, I am glad that thou art in this place, and thou art close to where thou didst grow up, and where I did raise thee as a little girl. 

12 And Mary, while thou art here, come visit the place of thy childhood, for the spirit of thy father and of me do dwell in the house and on the grounds thereof--

13 Where we were taught of the Lord concerning thy coming, and knew that thou wouldst have a remarkable life, being graced with many visions from God. 

14 And thou, Mary, didst teach us often, and help us understand the wisdom of God. 

15 And Mary, our love is great for thee, and is greater than the love of thine in-laws; and though we are gone, our love persists with thee still, and is stronger than their enmity. 

16 And Mary, those who hate and despise the suffering servants of the Lord--they who hate thee and others like thee because of their perceived reputation--will not receive the blessed state of the righteous, and are commanded by God to repent.

17 And my heart took strength at this, and was comforted. 

18 And this was the time when I began to put weight in the words of my mother, and the visions she gave me, and the feelings I felt from them, more so than in the words I felt from the Spirit of God when I prayed to him. 

19 And I feared because of this, for it seemed that my mother's words counteracted (or at least did not run parallel with) the words and feelings from the Spirit of God. 

20 But despite my fear, they brought me greater joy and wisdom and closeness and strength. 

21 And I did set my heart upon her words and visions and teachings and her self, though I did not speak to Jesus about this. 

22 For I respected his teachings and my closeness with him, and I feared that he would teach me to stop praying to my mother;

23 Nevertheless, he had never forbade me from doing so before, and had even confirmed my mother's words, and so I pondered on these things.
## CHAPTER 25
1 And behold, on the morrow, we set out with Simon and Judas to find the home of Tabitha, and see if she still lived there.

2 And as we walked, I talked with Jesus about the vividness of my visions of my mother; 

3 (and behold, she went by Anna in her life, so that Mary the elder might not be confused with Mary the younger).

4 And I told Jesus how her presence was as strong to me as if she were alive and with me still--

5 And yet that I felt closer with her emotionally than I had in a long time when she was alive. 

6 And Jesus listened deeply, as he always does.

7 And he asked his disciples if they had had any experiences like this---speaking to deceased loved ones.

8 And neither answered him, but Judas looked uncomfortable; and Jesus did not press the matter.

9 But later on down the road, after the space of about half an hour, having perceived that Judas had something to say, Jesus asked Judas he might share the spiritual experiences that he had, including with the divine. 

10 And Jesus said, Judas, I have great confidence in thee; and behold, I have chosen thee, and I know that the things God chooseth to reveal to thee are of great import for the children of men.

11 But Judas spoke not, and seemed more ashamed, and Jesus did not ask him any more questions. 

12 And in my heart I wished the Judas did partake of the good things of God, and of his visions, and should share them with others. 

13 Yet at once, I also knew and understood how personal these visions are, and I knew that I only shared them with Jesus because he was my son. 

14 But I desired to ask Judas about this at a later date.

15 And Jesus changed the topic to other things, and all of us conversed and passed the time.

16 And Jesus, and Simon, and Judas, and I came to the gates, and there were goats grazing in the yard. 

17 And all of us went to the door of the house, and Tabitha answered. 

18 And her face was weathered, and her hair thinned and grayed, but her countenance was bright, and her eyes wrinkled with familiar smile lines when she saw us. 

19 And she brought us inside, and sat us at her table, and brought us bread to eat, for she had been baking. 

20 And Jesus thanked her and said, Tabitha, much good has come upon you because of your belief in the coming messiah and the kingdom of God. 

21 For God hath revealed unto thee that the messiah should come, and my mother Mary hath spoken with thee concerning this thing.

22 And, Tabitha, I would that I might break and bless this bread for all of us in attendance, in similitude of the gift the messiah shall give to all the children of men.

23 And he said in his prayer, O God, the eternal father, we come before thee today, broken and contrite from the burdens of the lone and dreary world;

24 And we ask, father, in the name of thy beloved son, that thou mayest fill our souls with life eternal, and with love for one another;

25 And as we eat this bread, which thou blessest for us today, even so we pray for and accept the bread of life, which fills our hearts, which thou givest in the form of thy beloved son, the messiah, whose time has come. Amen.

26 And a silence hung over us after Jesus finished his prayer; 

27 And Tabitha wept and thanked Jesus for his prayer, and began to worship him. 

28 And Simon and Judas began to prevent her, but Jesus said, Brethren, our God and father hath spoken to her, and she knows the secret of my life; 

29 And she and Mary my mother have spoken concerning this before.

30 And Simon and Judas abated, and rejoiced with Tabitha, and worshiped Jesus. 

31 And, though I was moved by his prayer, I wondered what he should mean, for some aspect of the prayer unsettled me. 

32 But I knew that my vision concerning Jesus' future sacrifice had scarred me deeply, and I tended to find reminders of it in even the most mundane or the most holy things. 

33 And Jesus did not teach any more while we were there, but we talked about Tabitha's life now, and her husband's livelihood. 

34 And she asked about me, and Jesus, and where we now lived, and how Jesus kept his livelihood while he was teaching and ministering with the disciples. 

35 And my heart was filled with joy being in her presence, and I was grateful to know she still thought of me and loved me, and was grateful that she and her husband were well enough off.

36 And behold, we stayed the night with Tabitha and her husband, and in the morning we awoke, and Jesus blessed and broke bread for us and for Tabitha's husband again. 

37 And the Spirit rested upon all of us. 

38 And Tabitha's husband's name was Joseph, and he asked Jesus questions concerning his ministry.

39 And Joseph said, Jesus, thou chosen of God, what messages hath God been inspiring thee to teach us, the children of men? 

40 And, rabbi, teach me, that I may teach others.

41 And Jesus smiled, and said, Joseph, I have looked upon thy heart, and know thee to be a true seeker of wisdom. 

42 And Joseph, thou seest my companions here, Simon and Judas; and they travel with me and teach;

43 And, Joseph, I would that thou shouldst teach with me also, for I have seen thy heart.

44 And Joseph wept, and said, Master, I have desired this thing, and my wanting came to a head when thou didst cross through my door, and I came to see thee.

45 And Joseph traveled with us thereafter, and was an earnest student, and a gentle and jovial companion to us;

46 And he brought a quietness, and a wisdom, and a humor that was unique among all members of the group. 

47 And behold, I wished that Tabitha should come with us, for I loved her very much;

48 But Tabitha's heart was torn, for though she missed her husband, and did desire to be with me, she had other responsibilities and engagements with her in-laws who lived with her. 

49 And behold, she and her in-laws tended the goats and sheep, and managed the fields, in Joseph's absence.
## CHAPTER 26
1 And as we traveled back toward Cana to meet with Alphaeus, we stopped in a village on the way, and Jesus healed a paralytic and one who had been possessed by demons. 

2 And as Jesus was teaching outside near the synagogue, Judas came to me, and said, Mary, what hath the Lord in store for thy son, Jesus? 

3 And whence cometh his kingdom of the Lord, and when?

4 And I told him I knew not when, but I did know that his kingdom was to be a spiritual one only, and not a political kingdom yet. 

5 And all should live in the kingdom in the manner he had described in his teachings, but only by the virtue of the word in their hearts, and not yet by the overthrow of the oppressive Roman government.

6 And Judas said, Yea, verily--for though I had hoped for a kingdom and a ruler, and for peace for our people, I knew that such a thing would not come shortly. 

7 But Mary, what other purpose serveth thy son here? For the prophets have taught us how to live in peace one with another, and Jesus doth remind us, and teach us greater things--

8 But why is the son of God here among us now? And what will happen when he cometh to the age of a man?

9 And behold, I loved Judas like a son, and I told him, The time cometh when some will reject Jesus, for they will be offended by those who say he is God's son. 

10 And these will come to violence against him. 

11 And Judas, I know these things because of the angel of the Lord who spake them to my heart; and Judas, they are hard for me to bear.

12 And my son, my heart is rent even now, and I can hardly think upon these things, let alone ask God about them again.

13 And he answered, Mary, this troubleth me also, for I never thought the son of man could die. 

14 And behold, he hath changed my life, and has been a better friend to me than any I have known, and hath brought me out of the sorrow in which he found me. 

15 For I had no thought for my own life, and wished that I were not;

16 But Jesus strengthened me, and taught me that God knoweth me, and my joy has been fulfilled in teaching others likewise.

17 And I said, Judas, I have something more to tell thee (and I said this with shame, and durst not say much): 

18 Judas, since the Spirit of God told me this concerning Jesus' fate, I have been less willing and desirous to reach out in prayer to the Lord our God.

19 And Judas put his arm on my shoulder, and smiled warmly, and comforted me, saying: 

20 Mary, I know thy heart, and it is good, and thou lovest thy son;

21 And if thy love for him should separate thee from the Lord thy God, it is well, and God knoweth thy heart; and Mary, the divine speaketh to my soul at this moment, and confirms to me the truth of these words.

23 And my heart was comforted, and was glad, and I praised the Lord my God.

24 And behold, we had spoken quietly for fear that the crowd should hear us, for we spoke of the most sacred things concerning Jesus and his ministry--

25 Not only concerning his divine sonship (which was not broadly known) but also things which no man or woman had heard, even concerning his fate in the hands of men. 

26 And I began to fear that others had heard us, for I noticed that the crowd had pressed closer, and were behind us; but Jesus taught on. 

27 And we soon departed again for Cana.
## CHAPTER 27
1 And Mary and the disciples went to Cana and found Alphaeus. 

2 And he was up upon the top of a roof, repairing it; and Jesus called up to him, saying, Alphaeus, come down, and rejoice, and celebrate with us, for another has joined our ranks; and come, and meet Joseph.

3 And Alphaeus rejoiced to see us, and to see Jesus again, and myself. 

4 And when he had come down, I asked him how he had been, visiting with his family here in Cana. 

5 He responded that he had visited with many of his close family members and extended family members, for he had not been home for some time;

6 And he told me their news, and who was having children, and who had gotten sick. 

7 And he ushered us to the home of one of his family members who had extra room, and paid them to give us room for the night.

8 And we did stay in Cana five weeks, and Jesus taught the people, and Alphaeus attended with us while Jesus taught. 

9 And I, at this time, began to love Alphaeus. 

10 And he had been married once, but had had no children, and his wife had died, and he was hesitant to marry again; 

11 But we grew close, and his familiarity with me was real. 

12 And soon came a great wedding for Alphaeus' wife's younger sister, and a great feast.

13 And there was much rejoicing and celebrating and dancing; and behold, the wine ran out quickly. 

14 And I came to Jesus, and said, My son, this is the happiest I've been in a long time, and Alphaeus is with me, and we have rejoiced tonight in each other's company, as have all the guests, and the bride and groom. 

15 But behold, with the wine gone, the celebration will end soon also.

16 And Jesus smiled and was quiet, and went away from us for about thirty minutes. 

17 And the guests were settling down, and preparing to leave, when the master of the feast came in and said he had found twelve cases of wine. 

18 And we all drank, and it was finer wine than any of us had before tasted. And we asked the master of the feast where he had found these.

19 And he said that he had passed over them earlier, because he had thought that they were cases of water, but somehow they must have gotten mixed up. 

20 And Alphaeus and I talked and sang and shouted with the rest. 

21 And Alphaeus whispered that he should like me to walk him home. 

22 And though my heart told me that sin might come of this, the divine part of me was flooded with joy and righteousness, and I did walk with him. 

23 And behold, the streets were mostly empty, as most people were asleep (for the hour was late) or they were attending the wedding feast. 

24 And as we came close to his door, we embraced. 

25 And he said nothing, but I, knowing his thoughts, said, Alphaeus, I would like to come in with thee, but I cannot offend God, and cause thee regret.

25 And he was quiet, and I said, Alphaeus, let us be wed; 

26 We are both growing older, and no harm can come of this; and it shall cause our friends and neighbors to rejoice, and we ourselves will give each other great joy all our lives.

27 And Alphaeus said, My heart is hopeful, Mary, but my mind cannot allow me to marry again; for my wife's memory lives on inside me still.

28 And I knew he would say something like this, but still it caused me pain to hear it. 

29 And I asked him, Alphaeus, pray unto the Lord thy God, and unto the spirit of thy wife, and ask for his blessing, and hers.

30 And when I said this, light overcame his eyes, and he said, Mary, the Spirit hath spoken with thee to my heart;

31 And I know that this choice is mine to make, and that my Isabel would rather see me happy. 

32 And the Lord God hath told me that we shall bear a son together.

33 And my heart swelled up to tears, for I knew that the Lord had spoken to me aright. 

34 And behold, we were married, and had a son, and called his name James. And he did bring light and joy to our lives.
## CHAPTER 28
1 And I lived out my days with Alphaeus in Cana, but visiting Capernaum often and seeing Abatha while Alphaeus did his work there. 

2 And Jesus and Alphaeus got on well as friends, and Jesus would occasionally help Alphaeus with his work. 

3 And I feared that Alphaeus that Jesus would ask Alphaeus to follow him and be his disciple. 

4 But the Spirit comforted me, saying, Jesus' disciples have been chosen before the earth was, and Alphaeus' duty is not with Jesus.

5 And I thanked the Lord my God for the first time since I had spoken with God in the village by Nazareth. 

6 And Alphaeus was not a man of visions, but he did feel the Spirit of God occasionally, and he was like my husband Joseph in some ways, as both were craftsmen, and both good businessmen. 

7 And Alphaeus, like Joseph, could become quiet and distant sometimes, and more focused on his work than I wished he would be;

8 But he found time for me, and honored me, and the pledge he had made to me, in choosing me as his wife. 

9 And I took the primary care of our son James, who suffered from coughing the first year of his life, but grew in strength. 

10 And Alphaeus had never been a father before, but he held this baby with tenderness. And Alphaeus was a gentle man. 

11 And when we talked, he listened deeply and showed care and affection in the way he interacted with me. 
## CHAPTER 29
1 And James reached the age of two.

2 And Jesus loved James, and played with him;

3 And when he visited Capernaum, and taught there, he held James up in his arms, and taught that God loveth the little children, and desireth all of us to be like them;

4 For though they make mistakes, and do not walk through this life perfectly, they do so with purity of heart, and are quick to learn, and to love, and to find joy. 

5 He taught us that God loveth the childlike part of each of us.

6 And about this time, Jesus told me he would soon travel down towards Jerusalem. 

7 And my mind became empty, and my heart remembered John's journey to Jerusalem. 

8 And my eyes could not weep, and my heart sank low, and I could not speak. 

9 Jesus said, Mother, I shall be with thee yet again, I promise thee;

10 And behold, my teachings in Jerusalem will be the greatest of all my ministry, and God our father will attend to me and will prepare the way.

11 And the thanks I had given to God before, for Alphaeus and my son, and for my son's health--

12 My thanks was closed up, and God became a dark figure to me once again. 

13 And I said, Jesus, allow me to come with thee.

14 And he said, Mother, I would that thou shouldst bring Alphaeus with thee, so that thou mightest be safe.

15 And I agreed, and bade Jesus to ask Alphaeus to come. 

16 And all that night, I wept and cried unto my mother and any other spirit that might help me. 

17 And my mother visited me, and held my face in her hand, and said, Mary, rejoice in thy son James, and know that Jesus will ever be with thee.

18 And my heart was not comforted, and I asked her, Will he be with me in the way that thou art with me? 

19 Or will he live in the flesh, and not die as did John--and as the angel of death did promise me?

20 And my mother Mary held me, and said, If he is with thee in the same way as I am, is that not enough? And the vision closed.
## CHAPTER 30
1 And behold, Alphaeus has gotten sick with a fever, and cannot go down with me to Jerusalem. 

2 And Jesus left two weeks ago, and behold, I know not how he is. 

3 And I hold my son James every day, and promise him that I shall not depart from him. 

4 And my heart wants to reach out to my mother in prayer, but I fear the answers I will receive from her.

5 And Mary durst not say this, but she also feared lest Alphaeus would not recover, and wondered how she should subsist, and care for her son James. 

6 And she wept, and finally openly cursed the Lord our God, saying, Lord, I have been faithful to everything that thou hast commanded me, and thou hast taken my son from me.

7 And God answered, and said, Mary, thou hast been faithful, and will receive thy reward. 

8 And know, Mary, that he is my son also.

9 And I wept, and prayed over Alphaeus in his fever, and wished that he might be lifted up again.

10 And behold, Abatha came down from Capernaum, and visited with me, and wept with me; and she is here with me still, and helps me care for James.
## CHAPTER 31
1 And behold, I, James, do write this record, and have compiled it from the many dictations my mother had with me, and with others of the disciples. 

2 And behold, my mother was a faithful woman, and one blessed by God, and chosen by him to do his difficult work of bearing and raising the son of God, who died, and rose again on the third day, and giveth life to us all.

3 And behold, Simon Peter, and James and John the sons of Zebedee have seen him, and bear witness to his glory. 

4 And behold, I know that their message is true, and that Jesus my brother liveth, and giveth life to all who follow him. 

5 And I share these things that they may be known unto the world, and that the world may know of the glory and the divine sonship of Jesus Christ, the son of God--

6 And may know that his coming into the world was brought about by miraculous intervention, through Mary, God's chosen, who was my mother. 

7 And behold, her tears and sorrows are consecrated by the Lord for all of us who seek to follow him, and I seek to remember, and honor, and sanctify her suffering, in teaching these things unto the world.

8 Now behold, I give my testimony that these things are true, for the Lord hath visited me in my heart. 

9 And behold, all those who will pray unto the Lord, and ask him for the grace and knowledge of his divine son, Jesus the Christ, may be blessed with the spirit of Christ to attend them in their greatest times of need.

10 And he may visit them, and give them peace, and comfort, and counsel, even as my mother was blessed with comfort and counsel from those beyond the grave.

11 And Jesus our Lord shall reign forever, by virtue of his giving peace to and teaching our hearts, and saving us from falling into the way of the devil.

12 Now behold, I have somewhat to say unto the world concerning my beloved mother, for she raised me well, and loved me deeply.

13 But she also did not enjoy the company of Simon Peter, and James and John, the sons of Zebedee--

14 For she wished they could have protected Jesus from his fate in Jerusalem. 

15 And she was more especially distant from Peter. 

16 And John she sometimes suffered, for she had loved John as a son, and Jesus had given John charge to take care of her. 

17 Yet, for all this, and all of Jesus' care, she still felt bitterness and anger.

18 And behold, I love my mother, and I pray that she may find peace in the rest of God. 

19 And as I grew older, I sought to understand this God of whom she spoke. 

20 And I learned from Simon Peter, and I was taught by him of the sorrow that he too felt at the passing of our Lord, and knew that he had suffered even as had my mother. 

21 But behold, he has seen our risen Lord; and behold, I know his testimony to be true, for the Spirit confirmeth it in my heart. 

22 And my earnest prayer is that all those whose lives have been ravaged by sorrow and despair may take hold upon this testimony, as did Simon Peter in his time of sorrow, and be comforted by the Lord our God, and Jesus, who is his Christ--

23 For he will be with us until the end of our days. Amen.
